      <h1>About Papa Louie</h1>
      <p>
        The Papa Louie series is a video game series created by Flipline
        Studios. Most of the games in the series combine restaurant management,
        cooking, and strategy gameplay as users run a restaurant and fulfill
        orders for customers. The first installment, Papa Louie: When Pizzas
        Attack!, was released as a free-to-play Flash game on November 9, 2006.
        While many future installments were also released as free-to-play Flash
        games, the series was later expanded to support mobile devices and
        Steam. The web games in the series were initially impacted by the
        shutdown of Adobe Flash December 31, 2020, but can now be played on
        websites including Cool Math Games using Flash Player emulators such as
        AwayFL.
